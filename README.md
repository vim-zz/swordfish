1. üí¨ Describe what you are doing
2. ‚ö°Ô∏è Run any terminal command and get their outputs to screen
3. ü§ñ Reproducible steps - iterate on the `screenplay` file till perfection
4. üòé Mimics real person behavior with realtime typing into terminal

## Demo

Example `screenplay.yaml` file:

```yaml
- !clear
# - !turbo {by: 3}
- !write {msec: 0, color: green, text:  "$ "}
- !write {msec: 20, text:    "i am going to list this dir"}
- !wait {msec: 1000}
- !erase {msec: 20, by_chars: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx }
- !wait {msec: 1000}
- !write {msec: 20, text: ls}
- !wait {msec: 1000}
- !execute {line: ls -la}
- !wait {msec: 3000}
- !write {msec: 1000, color: green, text:  "$ "}
- !write {msec: 20, text: "bye, press any key..."}
- !pause
```

Running `swordfish screenplay.yaml`:

## Quick start

1. Install: 

```
cargo install swordfish-rs
```` 

Requires Rust on your machine, get it from [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)

or [download a binary](https://github.com/vim-zz/swordfish-rs/releases)

2. Create this getting started screenplay file as `getting_started.yaml`:

```yaml
- !clear
- !prompt {color: green, text:  "$"}
- !write {msec: 20, text: "swordfish reads screenplay files, in yaml format"}
- !wait {msec: 2000}
- !erase {msec: 20, amount: 1000 }
- !wait {msec: 1000}
- !write {msec: 20, text: "it contains a list of commands, each command can have parameters that control it"}
- !wait {msec: 2000}
- !new_line
- !write {msec: 20, text: "that's it"}
- !new_line
```

3. Run swordfish

```
swordfish getting_started.yaml
```
